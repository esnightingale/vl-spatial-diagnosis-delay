## Abstract

### Background
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease targeted for elimination from the remaining endemic area of North-Eastern India, Nepal and Bangladesh. With no vaccine and potentially limited efficacy of vector control, the elimination programme depends strongly on prompt case detection and effective treatment. Case detection measures were intensified in India in 2016, yet a proportion of cases remain undetected many months after symptom onset. Substantial delays between onset of symptoms and diagnosis increases risk of onward transmission and could indicate points to improve in the surveillance system. Identifying where, when and in which populations excessive delays occur will likely be important for achieving and sustaining elimination.

### Methods
This work explored the spatial distribution in diagnostic delays via case records geo-located to the village of residence, accounting for individual level characteristics along with features of the location, such as indicators of recent incidence and accessibility of health facilities with VL capacity. We employed a geostatistical approach, modelling the residual delay distribution over space as a Gaussian Markov random field to capture the pattern of variation unexplained by the specified covariates. 

### Results
The analysis revealed important spatial variation in diagnostic delays with a spatial correlation range of around 50km. The areas highlighted in which cases appear prone to excessive delays are outside the existing endemic “hot spots”. These areas are not necessarily within the primary focus of the control programme but may be at risk of outbreaks or resurgence if the excess delay translates to onward transmission.

After accounting for individual-level sources of variation, cases diagnosed within officially recognised “endemic” blocks and in villages with recently reported incidence of VL were found to experience shorter delays on average (by 13% [2.9% - 21.7%] and 7% [1.3% - 13.1%], respectively) than those residing in less recently-affected areas. This could reflect the impact of waning awareness and detection effort in peripheral areas, as resources are increasingly narrowed to the remaining, persistently endemic hotspots. 

### Conclusions
At this stage in the path to elimination, delays to diagnosis of VL have the potential to influence whether the transmission cycle is broken or whether the disease resurges. Our findings provide motivation to consider whether purely incidence-based targeting of active case detection will be sufficient in this elimination setting.
